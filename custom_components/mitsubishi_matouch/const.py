# --- Vane (vertical airflow) <-> HA swing_mode keys ----------------------------
# The vane has up to 5 fixed positions plus auto + swing, surfaced via the climate swing
# control (gated by the per-unit vane capability). The mapped strings are stable machine
# KEYS (capabilities.VANE_*); Home Assistant renders the display labels + per-position
# icons from the entity translations / icons.json. Wire ordering is AUTHORITATIVE from the
# decompiled SDK: wire 3 = FLAT (airflow level), 5 = DOWNWARD20, 2 = DOWNWARD60,
# 1 = DOWNWARD80, 0 = DOWNWARD100 (fully down). (GeminiMobileData WindDirection.toRequestValue
# / convertDirectionToVane.)
#
# READ is mapped by the WIRE VALUE (not the MAVaneMode member) because MAVaneMode.NONE
# and STEP_5 both equal 0 — an enum lookup of 0 yields NONE, so a value table avoids
# that alias. SET maps the HA key to the right MAVaneMode member.

# --- Running state (unit_state) ------------------------------------------------
# unit_state is the low nibble of the status frame's running-state byte (SDK
# GeminiMobileData.UnitState wire values), decoded in models.Status. IMPORTANT — verified
# live on our slim/RAC units (2026-07-03, raw-frame diff across on/off/cooling): these
# units keep unit_state at NORMAL(0) the WHOLE time they are actively conditioning; the
# explicit COOL(5)/HEAT(6) values are City-Multi-only and never appear here. So NORMAL does
# NOT mean idle — it means "operating normally in the set mode." unit_state only leaves 0
# for the special outdoor states below, matching the MELRemo app (its status icon is
# power+mode; unit_state only drives the standby/defrost labels and the wait-multi blink).
# Consequently hvac_action derives the base action from the MODE when on (see
# climate.hvac_action) and uses these values only as overrides.
MA_UNIT_STATE_NORMAL = 0            # operating normally (actively conditioning per the mode)
MA_UNIT_STATE_STANDBY_HEAT = 1      # heat pre-warm  -> PREHEATING

MA_UNIT_STATE_REQUEST_COMP_OFF = 7  # compressor commanded off / satisfied -> IDLE

# Integration-wide option: prefer any REMOTE Bluetooth proxy (ESP32/ESPHome, Shelly,
# future tech — anything that isn't the host's own adapter) over the HOST's built-in /
# HCI Bluetooth radio for connections, REGARDLESS of RSSI — i.e. only fall back to the
# local adapter when no proxy can reach the device at all. Default on: the host radio
# is oversubscribed by many persistent connections, can't be near every unit, and is
# subject to WiFi/BT coexistence + USB3 interference + kernel-driver breakage — so a
# proxy is the better path in essentially every scenario except outright unavailability.
# "Remote" is detected negatively (not one of the host's own Bluetooth adapter MACs, from
# the habluetooth manager), so no per-proxy-type knowledge is hard-coded. Key kept as
# "prefer_proxy" for compat.

# Dispatcher signal (namespaced per entry, payload = subentry_id) fired once when a

# they appear only where supported rather than as permanently-unavailable phantoms.

# How often to re-evaluate a failing unit's availability. HA's DataUpdateCoordinator
# only fires entity updates on a success or the FIRST failure of a streak, so a
# time-based "stale" grey-out would otherwise never be re-checked during a sustained
# outage (the card stays online showing stale data). A timer nudges listeners while a
# unit is failing so it greys on schedule. The same tick re-evaluates the
# "wedged" (discoverable-but-won't-connect) Repairs notice below.
AVAILABILITY_TICK_INTERVAL = 15

# How long a unit may stay DISCOVERABLE (a proxy sees it advertising) while EVERY
# connect/poll fails before we raise a Repairs notice that its radio is likely wedged
# and needs a power cycle. Set well above the normal periodic drop-and-reconnect blip
# (and above the exponential backoff) so an ordinary recoverable hiccup never trips it;
# only a genuinely stuck unit (advertising yet unjoinable for this long) does.

# How long the device must keep answering operation/settings requests with
# ERROR_FROM_DEVICE (result 0x09) before we raise the "thermostat fault" Repairs notice.
# The device is connected and authenticates (so this isn't a link/wedge issue) but
# rejects everything — a unit stuck on an error/startup screen. Long enough that a user
# briefly in the on-device menus (which also returns 0x09) doesn't trip it; it clears the
# moment a poll succeeds.
